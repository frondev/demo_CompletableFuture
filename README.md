# Demonstration: CompletableFuture

## Introduction
This demonstrations shows the functionality of <code>CompletableFuture</code> and the benefits
over a sequential implementation and even the old <code>Future</code> way.  
To do this we will create and discuss an actual problem we had in the developing process of an 
authentication process with two external services involved.  
In the next sections I will describe the problem, the first solutions and in the end the 
<code>CompletableFuture</code> way to implement it.
